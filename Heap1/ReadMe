Here input_1 and input_2 are the input files which can be given by the user.


g++ -o a heap.cpp
./a 1/2 input_1 input_2

The result will be stored in outputfile and sorted file as asked for.

Also,
we used a rand.cpp function to feed random values as inputs
commands:
1--g++ -o a rand,cpp
2--./a
3--g++ -o a heap.cpp
4--./a 1/2 input_1 input_2

After 2-- it asks for the sizes of input1 and input2 , number of extract and insert operations.
