Here input_1 and input_2 are the input files which can be given by the user.


g++ -o a heap.cpp
./a 1/2 i1 i2

The result will be stored in outputfile and sorted file as asked for.

Also,
        we used a rand.cpp function to feed random values as inputs
        commands:
        1--g++ -o a rand,cpp
        2--./a
        3--g++ -o a heap.cpp
        4--./a 1/2 i1 i2

        After 2-- it asks for the sizes of input1 and input2 , number of extract and insert operations. 





Regarding the graphs

The information about plotting points is included in the report
5 graphs are attached in the folder graphs

1) extract_min_compare.png      : This graph compares the time taken by heap and a leftist heap to extract elements
2) insert_compare.png           : This graph compares the time taken by heap and a leftist heap to insert elements
3) meld_compare.png             : This graph compares the time taken by heap and a leftist heap to meld heaps
4) meld_heap.png                : This graph compares the time taken by heap to meld heaps
5) meld_lheap.png               : This graph compares the time taken by leftist heap meld heaps
